# POST-PROCESSING

## 10) PPP & Data Processing

### Step 1: Extract Base Station RINEX
**U-Center RINEX Export:**
- [ ] Open base station UBX log file in u-center
- [ ] File → RINEX Converter → Select UBX file
- [ ] Output: RINEX 2.11 or 3.03 format
- [ ] Ensure observation interval matches logging (1s typical)
- [ ] Export to .obs file for PPP processing

### Step 2: PPP Processing  
**Submit for Processing:**
- [ ] Upload RINEX file to an online PPP service like AUSPOS or CSRS-PPP service
- [ ] Processing options: Static, 24-hour session preferred
- [ ] Download results: coordinates in WGS84 geographic
- [ ] Convert to UTM Zone 48S (EPSG:32748) using coordinate conversion tool

**Record PPP Results:**
- [ ] PPP coordinates: E_ppp, N_ppp, Z_ppp (UTM 48S)
- [ ] Survey-in coordinates: E_survey, N_survey, Z_survey
- [ ] Calculate translation: ΔE = E_ppp - E_survey, ΔN = N_ppp - N_survey, ΔZ = Z_ppp - Z_survey

### Step 3: Apply Corrections in QGIS
**Data Import:**
- [ ] Open QGIS, create new project
- [ ] Import SW Maps Geopackage export (preserves CRS metadata)
- [ ] Verify CRS is EPSG:32748 (UTM Zone 48S) - should be automatic
- [ ] Verify all survey points imported correctly with proper geometry

**Apply PPP Translation:**
- [ ] Open Field Calculator for each layer in Geopackage
- [ ] Create new fields: `E_corrected = "x_coord" + ΔE`, `N_corrected = "y_coord" + ΔN`, `Z_corrected = "z_coord" + ΔZ`
- [ ] Calculate bed elevations: `bed_elevation = Z_corrected - pole_height`
- [ ] Update geometry: Use "Update Geometry" tool with corrected coordinates
- [ ] Save changes to Geopackage (preserves all metadata)
- [ ] Validate: Check point repeatability should remain ≤3cm after correction

### Step 4: Export for PtBox
**Create XYZ Point Cloud:**
- [ ] Select cross-section and control point layers from corrected Geopackage
- [ ] Right-click layer → Export → Save Features As
- [ ] Format: "Comma Separated Value [CSV]"
- [ ] Geometry: AS_XYZ (exports X,Y,Z coordinates)
- [ ] Layer options: GEOMETRY=AS_XYZ, CREATE_CSVT=NO
- [ ] Save as `site_name_YYYYMMDD_survey.csv` (will contain X,Y,Z columns)
- [ ] Rename to `.xyz` extension if required by PtBox

**Archive and Quality Control:**
- [ ] Save corrected Geopackage as `site_name_YYYYMMDD_corrected.gpkg`
- [ ] Export backup as GeoJSON with CRS metadata
- [ ] Verify coordinate ranges are reasonable for site location
- [ ] Check elevation values match expected riverbed depths
- [ ] Confirm XYZ file format compatible with PtBox import requirements
- [ ] Test import with small subset if possible

## Appendix D: Sample Video Collection

### Connect to PtBox
 - Put the PtBox in Maintenance Mode using the FTP service
 - Wait for the PtBox to come online again, and log in
 - Select "Aim the camera in the field"
 - Take a 5 second video and note the video name and timestamp
 - Ensure that all control points are visible in the video. Adjust if needed and take a new video.
 - Also take a photo, and use the photo to number the control points so that you have a reference to use when entering the control points into the PtBox software later.
 - **NOTE:** Do not try to start the cameras in this view. This PtBox has a bad camera, and attempting to start the bad camera will cause the PtBox to lock up.
