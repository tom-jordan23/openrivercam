## Fuse Map

All fuses are **5x20mm glass tube** type. Do NOT use US automotive blade fuses
(AGA/AGC) — they are 6.3mm diameter and will not fit these holders.

| Fuse | Rating | Protects | What Happens If It Blows |
|------|--------|----------|--------------------------|
| F1 (5V rail) | 5A | DDR-60G-5 buck converter and Pi | Pi loses power, camera stops |
| F2 (12V PoE) | 5A | Relay CH1 and PoE switch | Camera loses power, Pi stays running |

**Replacement fuses:** 5x20mm, 5A, slow blow (time-delay). RTC battery:
CR2032 coin cell in the Witty Pi 5 HAT+ holder (non-rechargeable, no
config.txt charging settings needed).

## Wire Color Code

| Color | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| **Red** | 12V positive |
| **Black** | Ground (GND) |
| **Yellow** | 5V power (buck converter to Pi, Pi to relay VCC) |
| **Blue** | GPIO signal — relay IN1 (PoE switch, GPIO 24) |
| **Green** | GPIO 18 data — WS2812B status LED |

## Bulkhead Connectors (outside → inside)

| Connector | Type | Carries | Pin Map |
|-----------|------|---------|---------|
| SP13 | DC power | 12V solar input | + / − |
| CNLINKO | Ethernet IP67 | PoE camera data+power | Standard RJ45 |
| SD16 4-pin | Rain gauge | 12V + GND + UART TX/RX | 1:12V, 2:GND, 3:TX→RX, 4:RX→TX |

## Relay Channels

| CH | GPIO | Load | State when Pi is OFF |
|----|------|------|----------------------|
| 1 | GPIO 24 | PoE switch (camera) | **OFF** (fail-safe: camera unpowered) |
| 2 | — | Available for future use | OFF |
| 3 | — | Available for future use | OFF |
| 4 | — | Available for future use | OFF |

All relays use **NO (Normally Open)** contacts. When the Pi loses power or
crashes, all relays open and all loads lose power. This is intentional —
it prevents the camera from draining the solar battery.

## Status LED

Single WS2812B (NeoPixel) RGB LED behind sealed acrylic light window.
Driven by 1 GPIO data pin + 5V power. No relay channels used.

| Color | Pattern | Meaning |
|-------|---------|---------|
| Green | Solid | System OK, idle |
| Green | Flash | Capturing video |
| Green | Slow pulse | Shutting down |
| White | Solid | Boot in progress |
| Cyan | Solid | Maintenance mode active |
| Red | Solid | Camera offline (normal between cycles) |
| Red | Flash | Capture failed |
| Blue | Solid/flash | Network/LTE problem |
| Yellow | Solid/flash | Storage problem |
| Magenta | Solid | Power issue |
| OFF | — | Pi is off / sleeping (normal between cycles) |

## RTC (Witty Pi 5 HAT+)

- **Type:** CR2032 coin cell (non-rechargeable, on Witty Pi 5 board)
- **I2C address:** 0x51
- **Software:** `wp5` CLI, `wp5d` daemon (auto-starts at boot)
- **Pi 5 native RTC (J5):** Not used — ML-2020 connector failed on both boards
- **No `dtparam=rtc_bbat_vchg` needed** — Witty Pi 5 has its own RTC

---

## Power Button

The power button (Pi 5 J2 header) handles all power and maintenance functions:

- **Brief press:** power on (from halted) or clean shutdown (while running)
- **Long press (3 seconds):** enter maintenance mode (WiFi hotspot + SSH)
- **10-second hold:** force power off (if frozen)

## Maintenance Mode

1. Long press power button (3 seconds)
2. Pi starts WiFi hotspot
3. Connect to hotspot with laptop/phone
4. SSH to Pi for diagnostics
