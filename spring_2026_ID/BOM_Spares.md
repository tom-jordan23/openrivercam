## Procurement Strategy

### Ship with Primary Equipment
- All common spares
- Site-specific spares
- Consumables (except SIM cards)

### Source Locally in Indonesia
- SIM cards (Telkomsel - activate in-country)
- Basic tools (screwdrivers, wrenches) - available at ACE Hardware
- Electrical tape, cable ties, sealant - hardware stores
- Microfiber cloths - any store

### Order on Demand (After Failure)
- Replacement Pi 5 (if budget tight)
- Replacement modem
- Replacement cameras
- PoE injector
- Power supply

## Storage Requirements

**Environment:** Climate-controlled office space
- Temperature: 15-30°C (avoid extreme heat)
- Humidity: <70% RH (store electronics in sealed bags with desiccant)
- Away from direct sunlight

**Organization:**
- Label all spares with site compatibility (S = Sukabumi, J = Jakarta, B = Both)
- Keep pre-imaged SD cards in anti-static bags, labeled with image date
- Store conformal coating upright, sealed
- Keep documentation laminated copies with spares

**Inventory Tracking:**
- Check inventory after each site visit
- Reorder consumed items within 2 weeks
- Annual audit of all spares
