# OpenRiverCam Hardware Build Project

## Project Overview
This project builds a low-cost, open-source river monitoring station using computer vision to measure water flow in Indonesian rivers. The hardware system will be deployed in collaboration with the Indonesian Red Cross (PMI) to improve flood monitoring and community disaster preparedness.

## Hardware Mission Statement
Build a weatherproof, solar-powered monitoring station that can operate autonomously in tropical jungle conditions for extended periods, capturing video data for the OpenRiverCam software to analyze river flow patterns.

## Core Hardware Requirements

### Primary Components
- **Raspberry Pi 5** - Main computing platform
- **High-quality camera module** - For video capture of river flow
- **4G cellular connectivity** - For data transmission to remote servers
- **Solar power system** - Primary power source for autonomous operation
- **Battery backup** - For continuous operation during low-light periods
- **Weatherproof enclosure** - Protection against Indonesian tropical climate

### Environmental Challenges
- **High humidity** - Tropical jungle environment requires active humidity management
- **Condensation prevention** - Camera lens must remain clear for accurate readings
- **Temperature variation** - System must handle day/night temperature swings
- **Weather resistance** - Must withstand heavy rainfall and storms
- **Remote deployment** - System must operate without maintenance for extended periods

### Operational Requirements
- **Power cycling capability** - Automated system reboot and power management
- **Video capture scheduling** - Regular video recording with specific file naming conventions
- **Data processing** - Local processing of OpenRiverCam algorithms
- **Remote transmission** - Upload processed results to remote servers
- **Autonomous operation** - Minimal human intervention required

## Hardware Design Goals
- Cost-effective solution suitable for multiple deployments
- Locally buildable and maintainable in Indonesia
- Robust operation in challenging environmental conditions
- Integration with existing OpenRiverCam software stack
- Scalable design for network of monitoring stations

## Current Phase
**Multi-Budget Hardware Specification and Parts Sourcing** - Define detailed technical specifications and identify suitable commercial components for three distinct budget tiers, allowing for flexible deployment strategies based on available funding and operational requirements.

## Budget Tier Strategy

### Low Budget Tier (~$200-300 USD)
- **Target Use Case**: Basic monitoring for proof-of-concept or high-volume deployments

### Mid Budget Tier (~$400-500 USD)
- **Target Use Case**: Standard deployment for reliable long-term monitoring
- **Focus**: Balanced cost-effectiveness with robust operation
- **Trade-offs**: Good reliability with reasonable feature set

### High Budget Tier (~$600-800 USD)
- **Target Use Case**: Critical monitoring locations requiring maximum reliability
- **Focus**: Premium components and redundant systems
- **Trade-offs**: Higher cost for enhanced durability and autonomous operation
