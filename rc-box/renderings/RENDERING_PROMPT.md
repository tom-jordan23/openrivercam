## 1. Hero Shot - Complete Installation

```
Product rendering of a solar-powered river monitoring station mounted on a 4-inch diameter galvanized steel utility pole. The system includes:

- A white rectangular IP67 weatherproof enclosure (approximately 400x300x200mm) with visible cable glands, a small OLED status display on the front, and a red PMI (Palang Merah Indonesia / Indonesian Red Cross) logo printed on the enclosure
- A 100W monocrystalline solar panel mounted above the enclosure at a 30-degree angle
- Two small cylindrical weatherproof cameras (black, IP68 rated) mounted on a single rigid aluminum stereo bar (approximately 300mm wide) with an integrated sun shade, the entire assembly attached to a single pan/tilt swivel mount extending from the pole, pointed downward toward water
- A compact rectangular IR floodlight mounted below the cameras
- External cellular antenna (black whip style) mounted on top

The pole is installed on a riverbank with a tropical river visible in the background. Golden hour lighting. Professional product photography style, clean and modern industrial design aesthetic. The equipment looks rugged but refined, suitable for humanitarian field deployment.

## 2. Enclosure Detail - Front View

```
Close-up product photograph of a white IP67 weatherproof electronics enclosure, approximately 400x300x200mm. Front panel details include:

- A small monochrome OLED display (about 1.5 inches) showing status information
- Four rugged waterproof toggle switches in a row, labeled with embossed icons
- A recessed reset button
- Stainless steel latches securing the lid
- A red PMI (Palang Merah Indonesia / Indonesian Red Cross) logo printed prominently on the front panel

The enclosure has a professional industrial design with rounded corners and a tongue-and-groove seal visible at the lid edge. Side view shows black IP68 cable glands of various sizes (M12, M16, M20) with cables entering. Clean white background, studio product photography lighting, slight shadow underneath. Modern, minimal, rugged aesthetic.

## 3. Enclosure Interior - Open View

```
Product photograph showing the interior of an open weatherproof electronics enclosure. Inside view reveals:

- A Raspberry Pi 5 single-board computer mounted on DIN rail
- A green circuit board power management HAT attached to the Pi
- A black USB cellular modem with antenna pigtail
- A compact M.2 SSD in an enclosure
- Organized wiring with colored cables (red, black, yellow, green) routed through cable channels
- Terminal blocks for power distribution
- A small relay module
- Clear labeling on all connections

The enclosure lid is hinged open showing the intact rubber gasket seal. Professional cable management with zip ties and labels. All components are securely mounted. Clean, organized, field-serviceable appearance. Studio lighting on white background. The image conveys quality engineering and ease of maintenance.

## 4. Power System Detail

```
Product photograph of a weatherproof outdoor electrical enclosure opened to show a solar power system. Interior contains:

- A compact MPPT solar charge controller with LCD display showing battery status
- A black 12V 50Ah LiFePO4 battery with visible terminal connections
- A DIN rail with fuse holders and terminal blocks
- Red and black power cables with crimped ring terminals
- A ground lug bonded to the enclosure

MC4 solar connectors enter through weatherproof glands at the top. Clean professional installation with labeled wires. The enclosure is white/light gray fiberglass with stainless steel hinges. Outdoor setting slightly visible in background blur. Professional product photography style.

## 5. Camera Mount Detail - Rigid Stereo Bar

```
Close-up product photograph of a rigid stereo camera mount system. The assembly consists of:

- A horizontal aluminum bar (approximately 300mm long, powder-coated black or silver) serving as the stereo baseline
- Two identical cylindrical black weatherproof cameras (IP68 rated, approximately 50mm diameter x 100mm long) mounted at each end of the bar
- Both cameras point in exactly the same direction with parallel optical axes
- An integrated sun shade/hood spanning the full width of the bar, protecting both camera lenses
- USB cables exit from the back of each camera, routed along the bar with cable clips
- The bar attaches to a single heavy-duty pan/tilt swivel mount with a prominent locking lever
- The swivel mount connects to a stainless steel pole clamp

The design emphasizes that both cameras move together as a single unit - there are no individual camera adjustments. The only adjustment point is the central swivel. Clean product photography on white background, showing the mount from a 3/4 angle to reveal both cameras and the rigid bar construction. Professional industrial design aesthetic.

## 6. Field Deployment - River Site

```
Wide environmental photograph of a river monitoring station deployed at a tropical river crossing. The scene shows:

- A galvanized steel pole (about 3 meters tall) installed on a concrete pad on the riverbank
- Solar panel at the top angled toward the sun
- White weatherproof enclosure with red PMI (Indonesian Red Cross) logo mounted mid-pole
- Two cameras mounted together on a rigid stereo bar with sun shade, pointing toward the river
- IR spotlight visible below cameras
- A separate small rain gauge on a shorter pole nearby

The river is approximately 20 meters wide with visible flow. Lush green tropical vegetation on both banks. Partly cloudy sky. The installation looks professional and permanent but unobtrusive. Documentary photography style, natural lighting, showing the equipment in its operational context. The image conveys reliability in remote, challenging environments.

## 7. Installation Comparison - Two Configurations

```
Split-image product comparison showing two configurations of a solar-powered monitoring system:

LEFT SIDE: "Two-Box Configuration"
- Smaller white enclosure with red PMI logo (compute unit) mounted on pole
- Separate larger white enclosure with red PMI logo (power unit) mounted below it
- Cables connecting the two boxes
- Labels indicating "Compute Box" and "Power Box"

RIGHT SIDE: "Combined Configuration"
- Single larger white enclosure with red PMI logo containing all components
- Same solar panel and cameras as left side
- Simpler installation with fewer external cables
- Label indicating "Combined Unit"

Both configurations show the same external components: solar panel on top, rigid stereo camera bar with two cameras, cellular antenna. Clean diagram-style product rendering with white background, showing the two options side by side for comparison. Professional, technical illustration style.

## 8. Night Operation

```
Atmospheric photograph of a river monitoring station operating at night. The scene shows:

- The monitoring station silhouetted against a dark blue twilight sky
- IR spotlight casting a subtle reddish glow on the river surface (850nm IR, faintly visible)
- Small LED status light glowing on the enclosure
- Stars visible in the sky
- River reflecting the last light of dusk
- Tropical vegetation as dark silhouettes

The image conveys 24/7 autonomous operation in remote locations. Moody, documentary style photography. The equipment is functional and unattended, doing its job through the night.

## Usage Tips for DALL-E 3

1. **Use ChatGPT Plus** - Paste the prompt directly into a conversation
2. **Request variations** - Ask for "a more technical/industrial version" or "warmer/friendlier aesthetic"
3. **Iterate** - If elements are wrong, ask to modify specific details
4. **Aspect ratio** - Add "wide format 16:9" or "square format" if needed
5. **Style keywords that work well:**
   - "Product photography"
   - "Professional product rendering"
   - "Industrial design"
   - "Technical illustration"
   - "Documentary photography"
