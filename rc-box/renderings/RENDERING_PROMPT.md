Product rendering of a solar-powered river monitoring station mounted on a 4-inch diameter galvanized steel utility pole. The system includes:

- A white rectangular IP67 weatherproof enclosure (approximately 400x300x200mm) with visible cable glands, a small OLED status display on the front, and a red PMI (Palang Merah Indonesia / Indonesian Red Cross) logo printed on the enclosure
- A 100W monocrystalline solar panel mounted above the enclosure at a 30-degree angle
- Two small cylindrical weatherproof cameras (black, IP68 rated) on adjustable articulating arms extending from the pole, pointed downward toward water
- A compact rectangular IR floodlight mounted below the cameras
- External cellular antenna (black whip style) mounted on top

The pole is installed on a riverbank with a tropical river visible in the background. Golden hour lighting. Professional product photography style, clean and modern industrial design aesthetic. The equipment looks rugged but refined, suitable for humanitarian field deployment.

## 6. Field Deployment - River Site

```
Wide environmental photograph of a river monitoring station deployed at a tropical river crossing. The scene shows:

- A galvanized steel pole (about 3 meters tall) installed on a concrete pad on the riverbank
- Solar panel at the top angled toward the sun
- White weatherproof enclosure with red PMI (Indonesian Red Cross) logo mounted mid-pole
- Two cameras on articulating arms pointing toward the river
- IR spotlight visible below cameras
- A separate small rain gauge on a shorter pole nearby

The river is approximately 20 meters wide with visible flow. Lush green tropical vegetation on both banks. Partly cloudy sky. The installation looks professional and permanent but unobtrusive. Documentary photography style, natural lighting, showing the equipment in its operational context. The image conveys reliability in remote, challenging environments.

## 7. Installation Comparison - Two Configurations

```
Split-image product comparison showing two configurations of a solar-powered monitoring system:

LEFT SIDE: "Two-Box Configuration"
- Smaller white enclosure with red PMI logo (compute unit) mounted on pole
- Separate larger white enclosure with red PMI logo (power unit) mounted below it
- Cables connecting the two boxes
- Labels indicating "Compute Box" and "Power Box"

RIGHT SIDE: "Combined Configuration"
- Single larger white enclosure with red PMI logo containing all components
- Same solar panel and cameras as left side
- Simpler installation with fewer external cables
- Label indicating "Combined Unit"

Both configurations show the same external components: solar panel on top, two cameras on arms, cellular antenna. Clean diagram-style product rendering with white background, showing the two options side by side for comparison. Professional, technical illustration style.

## 8. Night Operation

```
Atmospheric photograph of a river monitoring station operating at night. The scene shows:

- The monitoring station silhouetted against a dark blue twilight sky
- IR spotlight casting a subtle reddish glow on the river surface (850nm IR, faintly visible)
- Small LED status light glowing on the enclosure
- Stars visible in the sky
- River reflecting the last light of dusk
- Tropical vegetation as dark silhouettes

The image conveys 24/7 autonomous operation in remote locations. Moody, documentary style photography. The equipment is functional and unattended, doing its job through the night.
