# 6.4 Survey Accessibility at All Water Levels

OpenRiverCam requires accurate surveying to measure the river cross-section and establish the relationship between water level and cross-sectional area. This surveying must be possible at multiple water levels to fully characterize the channel and develop a reliable rating curve. This section explains why multi-level access is critical and how to assess whether a site provides adequate survey accessibility throughout the year.

By the end of this section, readers will develop understanding of why surveying at multiple water levels is necessary, develop skills to assess physical accessibility for survey teams, learn to evaluate safety considerations at different flow conditions, gain knowledge for planning permanent marker placement, and acquire the ability to make informed site selection decisions based on accessibility requirements.

## Review: Why We Survey Rivers

### The Survey Purpose

As explained in Section 3.1, discharge equals velocity multiplied by cross-sectional area: **Q = v × A**

OpenRiverCam measures velocity (v) using the camera. To calculate discharge, we must know the cross-sectional area (A). This requires two types of information:

**1. Channel bathymetry (bed shape):**
The physical profile of the riverbed from bank to bank. This tells us the channel shape - how wide it is, how deep the center is compared to the edges, where the deepest point is located.

**2. Current water level:**
How high the water surface is at any given moment. Combined with the bathymetry, this tells us how much of the channel is filled with water, which determines the cross-sectional area.

**The surveying requirement:**
We must physically measure the riverbed elevation at many points across the width to create an accurate bathymetric profile. We must also establish permanent reference markers so we can measure water level accurately and consistently over time.

### Why Multiple Water Levels Matter

**The rating curve challenge:**

As described in Section 3.4, a rating curve shows the relationship between water level and discharge. To develop this curve, we need discharge measurements at many different water levels - low, normal, high, and ideally flood conditions.

**The survey need:**
To measure discharge at different water levels, we need the cross-sectional area at each level. This requires:
- Accurate bathymetry (surveyed once, valid until channel changes)
- Accurate water level measurement at each different stage

**The accessibility requirement:**
Survey teams must be able to reach the measurement cross-section safely to:
1. **Initial bathymetric survey:** Map the riverbed when water is low enough to access most of the cross-section
2. **Water level measurements:** Record water level at different stages throughout the year
3. **Verification surveys:** Re-measure bathymetry if channel changes are suspected (after major floods)
4. **Marker maintenance:** Check and maintain permanent reference markers

If the site is inaccessible during certain water levels (e.g., flood conditions), we may miss critical measurements or be unable to maintain the system.

## What "Accessibility" Means

### Multiple Dimensions of Access

Accessibility encompasses several considerations:

### Physical Access to the Site

**Can survey teams reach the general area?**
- Road or trail exists to within reasonable walking distance (<1 km)
- Terrain is traversable (not cliff faces, dense vegetation, swamps)
- No physical barriers (fences, private property, restricted areas)
- Transport of survey equipment is feasible (GPS rover, survey pole, etc.)

**Real-world consideration:**
Survey equipment is relatively portable (GPS receiver, survey pole, measuring tape, boat or wading gear), but teams still need vehicle access to within a reasonable distance. A site requiring 5 km hike through dense forest is impractical.

### Access to the Water's Edge

**Can survey teams reach the riverbank safely?**
- Bank slope is not too steep (can descend to water level)
- Bank is stable (not actively eroding or collapsing)
- Vegetation is not impenetrable
- No dangerous obstacles (cliffs, unstable slopes, deep mud)

**Real-world consideration:**
Steep, vegetated banks can often be managed with basic trail clearing or steps. Vertical cliffs or unstable slopes may be insurmountable.

### Access to the Measurement Cross-Section

**Can survey teams reach all parts of the cross-section?**

This is the critical accessibility question. Surveying requires measuring elevations at 10-20 points across the full river width. Teams must be able to reach each point, which typically means:

**At low water:**
- Wading across the river to measure bed elevations
- Using a boat if sections are too deep to wade
- Accessing both banks to anchor measurement equipment

**At high water:**
- Boat-based measurements if water is too deep/fast for wading
- Or acceptance that high-water bathymetry cannot be directly measured (must be estimated from low-water surveys)

**The fundamental challenge:**
The conditions best for surveying (low water, accessible bed) are different from the conditions most important for discharge monitoring (high water, flood events). Sites must accommodate access during both extremes.

## Why We Need Access at Multiple Water Levels

### The Rating Curve Development Process

Recall from Section 3.4 that rating curves are developed by measuring discharge at many different water levels. Let's trace how accessibility at different stages affects this process.

### Low Water Access: Establishing Bathymetry

**When:** Dry season, low flow conditions
**Purpose:** Survey the riverbed profile across the full cross-section

**What happens:**
- Survey team wades across river or uses shallow-draft boat
- Measures elevation at 10-20 points across the width
- Creates detailed bathymetric profile

**Why this matters:**
This establishes the channel shape. Once mapped, we can calculate cross-sectional area for any water level using the bathymetry plus current water level.

**Accessibility requirement:**
Must be able to safely reach points across the full width. At low water, this usually means wading. If the site has sections that remain too deep to wade even at low water, boat access is needed.

**Real-world example from Sukabumi:**
During October (late dry season), water level was at annual minimum. Survey team was able to wade across most of the cross-section, with water depth <1 meter across 80% of the width. The deepest central channel (1.5 meters) was measured from a small boat. This low-water access allowed complete bathymetric survey.

### Normal Water Access: Verification and Marker Placement

**When:** Moderate flow conditions, typical water levels
**Purpose:** Install and verify permanent markers, conduct verification measurements

**What happens:**
- Install staff gauges or permanent benchmarks on banks
- Verify camera positioning and field of view
- Conduct verification discharge measurements (optional, if ADCP or current meter available)

**Why this matters:**
Permanent markers must be installed when water is at moderate levels - not so low that markers will be high above the water during normal conditions (making them hard to read), not so high that they'll be underwater during normal conditions.

**Accessibility requirement:**
Must be able to reach both banks to install markers. May need to wade or boat to position markers at appropriate elevations.

**Real-world example from Sukabumi:**
Survey team installed permanent benchmarks on both banks during moderate water conditions (mid-range between low and normal flow). Markers were positioned to be visible across the full range of expected water levels. Bank access was good - stable, gently sloping banks allowed easy marker installation.

### High Water Access: Critical Measurements

**When:** Wet season high flows, approaching or at flood levels
**Purpose:** Measure water level, verify discharge during important events

**What happens:**
- Record water level from permanent markers
- Potentially conduct verification discharge measurements during high flows (if safe and equipment allows)
- Document flow conditions for rating curve development

**Why this matters:**
High-flow measurements are critical for rating curve development (see Section 3.4). These measurements occur during the conditions we most need to monitor (flood events for early warning), but are also the most challenging to obtain safely.

**Accessibility requirement:**
Must be able to reach banks or markers safely even when water is high and fast. This may mean:
- Safe viewing platforms (bridge, bank with railings)
- Permanent markers visible from safe positions
- Boat access if safe, or acceptance that boat-based surveys are not possible during extreme high water

**The trade-off:**
Complete bathymetric surveys during high water are rarely possible or safe. OpenRiverCam handles this by:
1. Surveying bathymetry at low water (maps the bed)
2. Measuring water level at high water (uses bathymetry + level to calculate area)
3. Measuring velocity at high water with camera (continues operating safely)

**Real-world consideration:**
High-water access typically means "can we see and record the water level from permanent markers" rather than "can we wade into the river." During floods, wading is unsafe and unnecessary.

## Safety Considerations at Different Flow Conditions

### Assessing Safe Access Throughout the Range of Flows

Safety is paramount. A site that requires teams to enter dangerous conditions to complete surveys is unsuitable regardless of other advantages.

### Low Flow Safety Assessment

**Typical hazards:**
- Slippery rocks on riverbed
- Uneven bed (trip hazards, sudden depth changes)
- Currents stronger than apparent (even shallow water can knock people over if fast)

**Safety indicators for low flow:**
- [ ] Can surveyors wade with water depth <waist height across most of the width?
- [ ] Is bed relatively stable (cobbles, bedrock) rather than unstable (deep mud, shifting sand)?
- [ ] Is current velocity manageable for wading (<0.8 m/s in shallow sections)?
- [ ] Are there safe entry and exit points on both banks?

**Mitigation measures:**
- Use safety ropes across the river for team members to hold
- Wear appropriate footwear (wading boots with good traction)
- Use survey poles as stability aids
- Work in teams (never wade alone)

**Decision threshold:**
If low-flow conditions prevent safe wading, can boat-based surveying provide adequate access? If neither wading nor boat access is safe, the site may be unsuitable.

### Moderate Flow Safety Assessment

**Typical hazards:**
- Increased current velocity
- Deeper water (less of the bed accessible by wading)
- Potentially unstable debris (floating logs, vegetation)

**Safety indicators for moderate flow:**
- [ ] Can critical points (banks, marker locations) be reached safely even if wading across the full width is not possible?
- [ ] Can boat be launched and operated safely if needed?
- [ ] Are banks accessible without entering fast current zones?

**Mitigation measures:**
- Shift to boat-based work if wading becomes unsafe
- Use permanent markers on banks to avoid needing to enter the river
- Schedule marker installation during lower flows if moderate flows are too hazardous

**Decision threshold:**
Moderate flows should allow safe access to banks and markers even if crossing the full width is not safe. If banks are inaccessible during typical conditions, the site is problematic.

### High Flow and Flood Safety Assessment

**Typical hazards:**
- Very deep, fast water
- Floating debris (trees, structures, hazardous materials)
- Bank instability or erosion during high flows
- Rapid water level changes

**Safety indicators for high flow:**
- [ ] Can permanent markers be viewed and read from safe positions (bridge, elevated bank, road)?
- [ ] Are there safe vantage points that remain accessible during floods (not cut off by high water)?
- [ ] Can camera and equipment be accessed for maintenance without entering hazardous areas?

**Critical principle:**
Teams should NEVER enter the water during flood conditions. All high-water activities must be observable and recordable from safe, dry locations.

**Mitigation measures:**
- Install permanent markers visible from safe vantage points
- Use camera-readable markers if possible (visible in camera field of view)
- Pre-plan safe access routes that work even during floods

**Decision threshold:**
If high-water conditions cut off all access to the site (roads flood, paths become impassable, no safe vantage points), the site is unsuitable. At minimum, there must be a safe way to reach permanent markers or camera equipment during extreme events.

## Permanent Marker Placement

### Establishing Reliable Reference Points

Permanent markers are critical for long-term monitoring. They provide consistent reference elevations for water level measurements and allow the rating curve to remain valid over time.

### Types of Permanent Markers

**Staff Gauges:**
- Vertical rulers mounted on banks or structures
- Graduated in centimeters, showing water level directly
- Easy to read visually or from camera

**Advantages:**
- Direct water level reading (no calculation needed)
- Can be read by camera if positioned in field of view
- Community members can read and report levels

**Installation requirements:**
- Stable mounting surface (bank, bridge abutment, concrete structure)
- Positioned to remain visible and accessible across full range of expected water levels
- Protected from damage (flood debris, vandalism)

**Survey Benchmarks:**
- Permanent ground markers with precisely known elevations
- Used as reference points for surveys
- Allow accurate water level determination even if staff gauge is damaged

**Advantages:**
- Very stable and permanent
- Surveyors can re-establish measurements from benchmarks
- Provide backup if primary markers are lost

**Installation requirements:**
- Secure installation in stable ground or structures
- Documented location and elevation
- Protected from disturbance

**Natural Features (Supplementary):**
- Rock outcrops, bedrock features, concrete structures
- Features with stable elevations that can serve as rough references
- Not primary markers but useful for cross-checking

[VISUAL PLACEHOLDER: Photos showing installed staff gauge on bridge abutment and survey benchmark on bank]

### Marker Placement Strategy

**Minimum marker configuration:**
1. **Primary staff gauge:** On one bank, visible from camera if possible
2. **Secondary staff gauge or benchmark:** On opposite bank (backup in case primary is damaged)
3. **Survey benchmark:** On stable ground near site (for re-establishing surveys if markers are lost)

**Optimal marker configuration:**
1. **Staff gauge in camera field of view:** Allows automated water level reading
2. **Additional staff gauge on opposite bank:** Manual reading backup
3. **Multiple survey benchmarks:** On both banks and nearby stable structures
4. **Painted elevation marks:** On bridge piers or structures showing specific water levels (e.g., flood warning level)

### Marker Placement Considerations

**Elevation range:**
Markers must span the full range of expected water levels:
- Lowest point: Below lowest expected water level (so marker is never out of range)
- Highest point: Above highest expected water level (so marker is not submerged during floods)

**Example:**
- Historical low water: 0.5 m
- Historical high water: 3.5 m
- Staff gauge should span from ~0 m to ~4 m (covers full range plus margin)

**Visibility:**
- Markers should be visible from safe vantage points
- Ideally visible from camera (allows automated level reading)
- Large enough to read from a distance (10-20 meters)

**Durability:**
- Materials resist weathering (corrosion-resistant metal, high-quality paint)
- Mounting resists flood forces (securely anchored)
- Design resists vandalism or accidental damage

**Accessibility for maintenance:**
- Can be reached for inspection and repainting
- Can be replaced if damaged without major construction work

**Real-world example from Sukabumi:**
The team installed:
1. Primary staff gauge on concrete bridge abutment, positioned to be visible in camera field of view
2. Secondary painted elevation marks on the opposite bridge pier
3. Survey benchmarks on both banks approximately 20 meters from the bridge

This configuration provided:
- Automated water level reading (camera can see primary gauge)
- Manual backup (secondary marks accessible from bridge)
- Permanent reference for future surveys (benchmarks)

All markers were installed during the initial low-water survey when safe access was possible, but positioned to remain functional during high water.

## Access During Different Seasons

### Seasonal Accessibility Patterns

River sites may have dramatically different accessibility across seasons. Evaluating seasonal patterns helps ensure the site can be surveyed and maintained year-round.

### Wet Season Considerations

**Typical challenges:**
- Roads may become impassable due to rain, flooding, or mud
- Rivers at high levels, limiting safe access to banks
- Vegetation growth may obscure paths or vantage points
- Weather conditions (heavy rain) may prevent survey work

**Assessment questions:**
- [ ] Does the site remain accessible by vehicle or short walk during wet season?
- [ ] Are there safe vantage points for viewing markers even when water is high?
- [ ] Will wet season vegetation growth block access or visibility?

**Mitigation strategies:**
- Select sites with all-season road access (paved roads, bridges)
- Pre-clear vegetation during dry season to establish permanent access paths
- Install markers that remain visible even during wet conditions

**Real-world pattern:**
Tropical sites with monsoon seasons may be inaccessible for weeks at a time during peak wet season. If the primary monitoring purpose is flood warning (requiring wet season operation), the system must operate autonomously during these periods. Markers must be installed and verified during accessible periods (dry season or early wet season before roads become impassable).

### Dry Season Considerations

**Typical challenges:**
- Very low water may expose banks that are unstable (dry, crumbling)
- Dust and heat may make surveying uncomfortable (not unsafe, but challenging)
- Some sites may have no flow at all (ephemeral rivers)

**Assessment questions:**
- [ ] Does the river maintain flow during dry season (even if minimal)?
- [ ] Are dry-season conditions safe for conducting bathymetric surveys?
- [ ] Will extreme low water expose marker bases or create visibility issues?

**Mitigation strategies:**
- Conduct bathymetric surveys during dry season when bed is maximally exposed
- Install markers positioned to remain visible even at extreme low water
- Plan annual maintenance during dry season when access is easiest

**Real-world pattern:**
Dry season is typically the optimal time for major survey work (bathymetry, marker installation, equipment maintenance) because access is safest and easiest. Schedule intensive activities during this period.

### Transition Periods

**Opportunities:**
- Early wet season: Roads still passable, water rising to moderate levels - good for installing markers at mid-range elevations
- Early dry season: Water receding, exposing bathymetry - good for initial surveys

**Challenges:**
- Rapidly changing water levels during transitions can make survey timing difficult
- Need to work quickly before conditions shift

**Strategy:**
Plan survey campaigns for early transition periods when conditions are favorable. Avoid late transition periods (late wet season = roads failing; late dry season = extreme low water).

## Real-World Example: Sukabumi Accessibility Assessment

### Applying the Accessibility Framework

During Sukabumi site selection, accessibility was a key differentiator among candidate sites.

### Site A: Natural Upstream Section

**General site access:**
- Vehicle access: Unpaved track to within 800m (Good)
- All-season access: Track becomes muddy and possibly impassable during heavy wet season rain (Marginal)
- Permissions: Public river, no restrictions (Excellent)

**Low water access:**
- Bank access: Moderate slopes, dense vegetation requiring clearing (Good)
- Cross-section access: Most of width wadeable at low water; central deep channel accessible by small boat (Good)
- Safety: Stable cobble bed, moderate current, safe with precautions (Good)

**High water access:**
- Marker visibility: Banks remain above flood levels but no elevated structures; markers would need to be viewed from bank edge (Good)
- Safe vantage points: Banks stable but not elevated structures (Good)
- Equipment access: Camera would be bank-mounted; accessible except during extreme floods (Good)

**Seasonal patterns:**
- Dry season access: Excellent for surveys (Excellent)
- Wet season access: Track may be impassable for 2-3 weeks during peak wet season (Marginal)

**Score: 6/9 - Good accessibility with wet season limitations**

**Concerns:**
The wet season access limitation was problematic because flood monitoring requires wet season operation. If the site becomes inaccessible during the critical monitoring period, maintenance and verification become impossible.

### Site B: Bridge Location (Selected Site)

**General site access:**
- Vehicle access: Paved road, bridge crosses river at site (Excellent)
- All-season access: Paved road always accessible (Excellent)
- Permissions: Public bridge and road, no restrictions (Excellent)

**Low water access:**
- Bank access: Concrete bridge abutments provide stable access to water level (Excellent)
- Cross-section access: Can access under bridge from banks; most of width wadeable at low water (Excellent)
- Safety: Stable access from bridge, safe wading in shallow areas (Excellent)

**High water access:**
- Marker visibility: Markers installed on bridge structures, visible from bridge deck (safe, elevated position) (Excellent)
- Safe vantage points: Bridge provides ideal safe viewing platform during all flows (Excellent)
- Equipment access: Camera mounted on bridge railing; accessible from deck (safe) during all water levels (Excellent)

**Seasonal patterns:**
- Dry season access: Excellent - bridge provides access regardless of water level (Excellent)
- Wet season access: Excellent - paved road and bridge remain accessible throughout wet season (Excellent)

**Score: 9/9 - Excellent accessibility year-round**

**Advantages:**
This site's accessibility was a major factor in its selection. The bridge provided:
- All-weather vehicle access
- Safe working platform for installation and maintenance
- Permanent structure for marker installation
- Safe vantage point for observations during floods
- Year-round accessibility for verification and monitoring

While other sites had comparable hydraulic characteristics (tracers, flow uniformity), the bridge site's accessibility made it operationally superior.

## When Accessibility is Challenging

### Strategies for Difficult Access Sites

Sometimes a site with excellent hydraulic characteristics has accessibility limitations. Several strategies can help:

### Strategy 1: Improve Access Infrastructure

**Approach:**
Invest in basic infrastructure to improve accessibility.

**Examples:**
- Clear vegetation to create permanent access path
- Install steps or railing on steep banks
- Build simple footbridge for crossing
- Grade and improve unpaved access track

**Considerations:**
- Cost and labor requirements
- Permissions (may require approval from authorities)
- Maintenance (vegetation will regrow, requiring periodic clearing)

**When justified:**
If the site is otherwise ideal and will be used long-term (years), infrastructure investment may be worthwhile.

### Strategy 2: Schedule Intensive Work During Optimal Seasons

**Approach:**
Conduct major survey and installation work during the season when access is best.

**Implementation:**
- Schedule bathymetric surveys during dry season when access and wading are safest
- Complete all equipment installation and marker placement during dry season
- Plan wet season as autonomous operation period (camera runs automatically, minimal site visits)
- Conduct annual verification and maintenance during dry season

**Considerations:**
- Requires seasonal planning and patience (may need to wait months for optimal conditions)
- System must be very reliable if wet season access is limited

**When justified:**
If wet season access is difficult but not impossible, and the primary monitoring purpose aligns with wet season operation (flood warning), this approach works well.

### Strategy 3: Remote Monitoring Capabilities

**Approach:**
Implement remote data access and monitoring to reduce need for site visits.

**Technologies:**
- Cellular or satellite data transmission (camera sends images and data remotely)
- Remote-readable water level sensors (transmit level data automatically)
- Camera-readable staff gauges (water level visible in images)

**Considerations:**
- Requires connectivity (cellular coverage or satellite link) and power for transmission
- Increases complexity and cost
- Still requires occasional site visits for maintenance, but reduces frequency

**When justified:**
If the site is periodically inaccessible (wet season road closures) but has cellular coverage, remote monitoring allows continuous data access even when physical access is impossible.

### Strategy 4: Accept Limitations with Planned Gaps

**Approach:**
Accept that certain activities cannot be performed during certain periods, and work around these limitations.

**Example:**
- Site is accessible during dry season (8 months) but inaccessible during peak wet season (2-4 months)
- Conduct all major surveys, marker installation, and maintenance during dry season
- Accept that wet season verification measurements cannot be conducted (rely on camera-based measurements and rating curve)
- Document gaps and limitations clearly

**Considerations:**
- Requires clear communication about system limitations
- May reduce confidence in wet season data if verification is impossible

**When justified:**
If gaps align with lower-priority periods (e.g., cannot verify during extreme floods, but these are rare events and normal wet season operation is more important), this may be acceptable.

## Integration with Overall Site Selection

### Accessibility in Context of Other Criteria

Accessibility must be balanced with tracers (Section 6.1), lighting (Section 6.2), and flow uniformity (Section 6.3).

### Accessibility as a Practical Multiplier

**Key insight:**
A site with perfect hydraulic characteristics (excellent tracers, lighting, flow uniformity) but poor accessibility may be impractical. Conversely, a site with good (not excellent) hydraulic characteristics but excellent accessibility may be more successful operationally.

**Why accessibility matters so much:**
- Installation requires safe access to mount camera and install markers
- Initial surveys require accessing the cross-section
- Ongoing maintenance requires periodic site visits
- Verification measurements validate system performance

**Without adequate accessibility, even the best site cannot be deployed and maintained successfully.**

### Decision Scenarios

**Scenario 1: Excellent hydraulics, poor accessibility**
- Site A: Tracers 9/9, Lighting 8/9, Flow 9/9, Accessibility 3/9

**Decision:**
This site will be very difficult to deploy and maintain. Unless accessibility can be improved (Strategy 1: infrastructure investment), consider alternative sites despite superior hydraulic characteristics.

**Scenario 2: Good hydraulics, excellent accessibility**
- Site B: Tracers 7/9, Lighting 7/9, Flow 7/9, Accessibility 9/9

**Decision:**
This site is operationally superior despite slightly inferior hydraulics. Good (not perfect) tracers, lighting, and flow are adequate. Excellent accessibility ensures successful deployment and long-term maintenance.

**Preferred:** Site B

**Scenario 3: Excellent hydraulics, marginal but improvable accessibility**
- Site C: Tracers 9/9, Lighting 9/9, Flow 8/9, Accessibility 4/9 (currently) → 7/9 (after clearing access path)

**Decision:**
If access can be improved with reasonable effort, this site becomes viable. The investment in access improvement is justified by the excellent hydraulic characteristics.

### Minimum Acceptable Accessibility Threshold

**Critical requirements:**
1. **Must be able to access the site for initial installation** (even if difficult, this is a one-time major effort)
2. **Must be able to reach markers from safe positions during floods** (ongoing operational requirement)
3. **Must be able to conduct bathymetric survey at least once** (establishes cross-section)

**If any of these minimum requirements cannot be met, the site is unsuitable regardless of other advantages.**

## Summary: Key Concepts for Accessibility Assessment

**Why accessibility matters:**
OpenRiverCam requires physical access to conduct surveys, install markers and equipment, and perform maintenance. Without adequate access, even hydraulically ideal sites are impractical.

**Access requirements at different water levels:**
- **Low water:** Bathymetric surveys (mapping riverbed) - requires safe access to cross-section via wading or boat
- **Moderate water:** Marker installation and verification - requires access to banks
- **High water:** Water level recording and monitoring - requires safe vantage points, marker visibility

**Safety considerations:**
- Low flow: Wading safety (depth, current, bed stability)
- Moderate flow: Bank access, boat launching if needed
- High flow/floods: Safe vantage points, NO entry into water

**Permanent marker placement:**
- Staff gauges (direct water level reading)
- Survey benchmarks (permanent references)
- Multiple markers for redundancy
- Positioned to span full range of water levels
- Installed during accessible conditions, functional during all conditions

**Seasonal access patterns:**
- Dry season: Optimal for bathymetric surveys, marker installation, major maintenance
- Wet season: May have limited access but must be able to monitor markers remotely
- Plan activities for accessible seasons; design for autonomous operation during difficult access periods

**Assessment framework:**
Evaluate general site access, low water access, high water access, and seasonal patterns. Score on 9 criteria. Sites with 8-9/9 points (excellent accessibility) are ideal; 6-7/9 (good) acceptable; 3-5/9 (marginal) challenging; 0-2/9 (poor) unsuitable.

**Strategies for difficult access:**
- Improve infrastructure (paths, steps, bridges)
- Schedule intensive work during optimal seasons
- Implement remote monitoring to reduce visit frequency
- Accept limitations with planned gaps

**Integration with other criteria:**
Accessibility acts as a practical multiplier. Excellent hydraulic characteristics are undermined by poor accessibility. Good hydraulics with excellent accessibility often outperform excellent hydraulics with poor accessibility.

**Minimum threshold:**
Must be able to install equipment, survey bathymetry at least once, and view markers safely during floods. Sites failing these minimum requirements are unsuitable.

**Real-world priority:**
In humanitarian deployments with limited resources and expertise, prioritize accessibility. Sites that teams can safely access and maintain will produce more reliable long-term data than hydraulically superior but inaccessible sites.
