# 6.5 Hydrologic Study Factors

Site selection is not just about finding a location where OpenRiverCam can function technically. Strategic site selection means choosing a location that will provide the right information to answer your specific questions. A flood warning system, water resource management program, and transboundary river monitoring effort all need river flow data - but they need measurements from different locations to be useful. This section explains how your monitoring objectives shape where you should place measurement sites.

By the end of this section, you will be able to:
- Align site selection with study objectives
- Understand catchment representation and what a site "tells you"
- Evaluate upstream vs. downstream placement strategically
- Consider tributary influences on measurements
- Plan multi-site monitoring networks
- Recognize when one site is insufficient for your needs

## Review: What Are You Trying to Learn?

### Monitoring Objectives Drive Everything

Before selecting any site, ask this fundamental question: **"What decisions will be made using this data?"**

This is not a philosophical question - it is intensely practical. Different monitoring objectives require measurements at different locations:

**Example 1: Flood warning for a specific community**
- **Objective:** Alert residents of Village A when floodwaters will arrive
- **Site requirement:** Measure upstream of Village A, far enough to provide warning time but close enough to represent flows that will reach the village
- **Wrong site:** Downstream of the village (data arrives after flooding occurs)
- **Wrong site:** Far upstream in different catchment (flows there do not relate to flows at village)

**Example 2: Water extraction sustainability for refugee camp**
- **Objective:** Ensure camp water pumping does not exceed sustainable river flow
- **Site requirement:** Measure immediately upstream of camp intake point, before any extraction occurs
- **Wrong site:** Downstream of extraction (already reflects removed water, does not show what was available)
- **Wrong site:** Far upstream before tributary joins (does not include full water resource)

**Example 3: Transboundary water allocation monitoring**
- **Objective:** Verify upstream country is releasing agreed minimum flows
- **Site requirement:** Measure immediately downstream of border, capturing flows entering your country
- **Wrong site:** Far downstream where local tributaries add water (obscures what crosses the border)
- **Wrong site:** Upstream in the other country (may not represent what crosses border if diversions occur)

These examples show that there is no universally "best" site. The right site is the one that measures what you need to know, where you need to know it.

## Understanding What a Site Represents

### Catchment and Contributing Area

Every measurement site on a river "represents" a certain area of land - the catchment (also called watershed or drainage basin) that contributes water to the river at that point.

**The fundamental concept:**

When rain falls on land, it flows downhill. A catchment is all the land area that drains to a specific point on a river. Everything upstream of your measurement site is part of the catchment. Everything downstream is not.

**Why this matters:**

Your measurement site tells you about conditions in its catchment:
- What is the total runoff from this catchment area?
- How quickly does this catchment respond to rainfall?
- What is the combined flow from all streams, tributaries, and direct runoff in this catchment?

Your measurement does NOT tell you about:
- Areas downstream (water has not reached your site yet, or your site has already been passed)
- Areas outside the catchment boundary (water flows in different directions, never reaches your measurement point)
- Specific tributaries or sub-catchments unless your site is positioned to isolate them

**Thinking in catchments:**

Imagine the land as a series of bowls. Rain falling inside a bowl flows to the bottom - the river. The rim of the bowl is the catchment boundary (drainage divide). Water falling inside drains one way; water falling outside drains somewhere else entirely.

Your measurement site is at the bottom of one bowl. It collects everything that falls inside that particular bowl. It knows nothing about adjacent bowls.

[VISUAL PLACEHOLDER: Topographic map showing a river network with a measurement site marked. Catchment boundary (drainage divide) shown in bold line. Shaded area shows the catchment contributing to this specific site. Labels indicate "Contributing area" inside boundary, "Different catchment" outside boundary]

### Catchment Size and Site Representativeness

**Small catchment measurements:**
- Represent local conditions
- Respond quickly to rainfall (hours)
- Useful for understanding specific sub-areas
- May not represent river behavior downstream where more tributaries join

**Large catchment measurements:**
- Represent regional conditions
- Respond more slowly to rainfall (days)
- Integrate contributions from many sub-catchments
- Better represent main river behavior
- Less sensitive to individual storm events

**Example from humanitarian context:**

A refugee camp is located on a tributary 15 km from where it joins the main river.

**Option A: Measure on the tributary near the camp**
- Small catchment (maybe 80 km²)
- Responds rapidly to local storms
- Tells you specifically about water available to the camp
- Does NOT tell you about the main river behavior

**Option B: Measure on the main river downstream of tributary junction**
- Large catchment (maybe 1,500 km²)
- Responds more slowly, integrates many tributaries
- Tells you about overall river basin behavior
- Does NOT specifically represent flows available to the camp

**Which is correct?**

It depends on your objective:
- Managing camp water extraction → Measure Option A (local tributary)
- Understanding downstream flood risk from camp operations → Measure Option B (main river)
- Comprehensive management → Need both sites

There is no single "representative" site. Each site represents its specific catchment. Choose the catchment that matches your information needs.

## Flood Monitoring Site Criteria

### Strategic Placement for Early Warning

Flood early warning systems have very specific site requirements driven by the need to provide actionable warning time while maintaining representativeness.

### Warning Time Requirements

**The fundamental trade-off:**

The farther upstream you measure, the more warning time you can provide - but the less directly the measurement represents conditions at the community you are protecting.

**Calculating warning time:**

Warning time equals the travel time for water to move from your measurement site to the at-risk location.

**Simplified estimation:**
- Fast-flowing rivers in steep terrain: Water travels 5-10 km/hour
- Moderate rivers in gentle terrain: Water travels 2-5 km/hour
- Slow, flat rivers: Water travels 1-3 km/hour

**Example calculation:**

Community at risk is 12 km downstream of potential measurement site. River is moderate, flowing approximately 4 km/hour during high flows.

Warning time = 12 km ÷ 4 km/hour = 3 hours

**Is 3 hours adequate?**
- For flash flood warning where evacuation is needed: Possibly yes
- For agricultural flood warnings (move livestock, harvest crops): Probably yes
- For urban flood preparation (deploy sandbags, raise valuables): Yes
- For flood forecasting only (no action needed): Certainly yes

**Is 3 hours too much?**

This seems like a strange question, but yes - warning time can be excessive if it comes at the cost of representativeness.

If you place the measurement site 50 km upstream to achieve 12 hours warning time, but the site is in a completely different sub-catchment with different rainfall patterns and tributary inputs, the measurement may not accurately predict what will happen downstream. You gain warning time but lose relevance.

**The balance:**

Optimal flood warning sites provide:
- Sufficient warning time for protective action (typically 1-6 hours minimum depending on actions needed)
- Strong hydrologic connection to the at-risk location (same river, main tributaries included, similar catchment characteristics)
- Reliable year-round accessibility for maintenance (see Section 6.4)

[VISUAL PLACEHOLDER: River profile diagram showing:

- Annotations showing trade-offs at each location
- "Sweet spot" indicated at 15 km site balancing warning time and representativeness]

### Flash Flood vs. Seasonal Flood Monitoring

Different flood types have different monitoring requirements.

**Flash flood monitoring:**

Flash floods occur within minutes to hours of intense rainfall, typically in small, steep catchments.

**Site criteria:**
- Must be relatively close to at-risk area (within 10-20 km typically) because flash floods move quickly
- Small catchment representation is acceptable - you are monitoring local conditions
- Very reliable, high-frequency data transmission is critical (hourly or more frequent) because conditions change rapidly
- Site must function during intense rain events (power, communications resilient to storms)

**Strategic consideration:**
Multiple small sites may be more useful than one regional site. Each village or vulnerable area may need its own local monitoring because flash flood conditions are highly localized.

**Seasonal flood monitoring:**

Seasonal floods develop over days or weeks as widespread rainfall accumulates and rivers gradually rise.

**Site criteria:**
- Can be located farther from at-risk area (50-200 km) because flood waves travel slowly and develop over days
- Larger catchment representation is desirable - you want to capture basin-scale behavior
- Moderate-frequency data (3-4 times daily) may be adequate because conditions change slowly
- Integration with upstream and downstream sites improves forecasting accuracy

**Strategic consideration:**
Fewer sites covering larger areas may be sufficient if supported by regional forecasting. Focus on key locations that represent major river reaches.

[VISUAL PLACEHOLDER: Two comparison panels:
1. Flash flood setup - Multiple small catchment sites near communities, steep terrain, short distances
2. Seasonal flood setup - Fewer sites on main river, gentle terrain, longer distances between sites and communities]

### Site Selection Decision Framework for Flood Warning

Use this framework to evaluate potential flood warning sites:

**Step 1: Define the area you are protecting**
- [ ] What communities, infrastructure, or assets are at risk?
- [ ] What is the specific geographic area requiring warning?

**Step 2: Determine required warning time**
- [ ] What protective actions need to occur? (evacuation, sandbagging, livestock movement, etc.)
- [ ] How much time do these actions require?
- [ ] What is the minimum acceptable warning time?

**Step 3: Map potential measurement locations**
- [ ] Identify locations upstream of at-risk area
- [ ] Calculate approximate warning times based on distance and flow velocity
- [ ] Eliminate sites providing insufficient warning time

**Step 4: Assess hydrologic representativeness**
- [ ] Which sites are on the same river that floods the at-risk area?
- [ ] Do all major tributaries join between the measurement site and at-risk area? (If yes, site may not represent full flow)
- [ ] Is the catchment at the measurement site similar in character to the catchment affecting the at-risk area?

**Step 5: Apply technical site criteria**
- [ ] Do potential sites meet tracer requirements? (Section 6.1)
- [ ] Do potential sites meet lighting requirements? (Section 6.2)
- [ ] Do potential sites meet flow uniformity requirements? (Section 6.3)
- [ ] Do potential sites meet accessibility requirements? (Section 6.4)

**Step 6: Balance warning time and representativeness**
- [ ] If multiple sites pass all criteria, prioritize sites that:
  - Provide adequate (not maximum) warning time
  - Have strong hydrologic connection to at-risk area
  - Include major tributary contributions
  - Have reliable access and infrastructure

**Outcome:**
Select the site that best balances practical warning time with hydrologic representativeness, while meeting all technical criteria.

## Water Resource Monitoring Criteria

### Strategic Placement for Sustainable Management

Water resource monitoring - whether for refugee camp supply, irrigation management, or environmental flow protection - has different strategic requirements than flood warning.

### Measuring Available Water vs. Actual Extraction

**Critical distinction:**

For water resource management, you must distinguish between:
1. **Available water:** The natural flow of the river before any human extraction
2. **Remaining water:** The flow after extractions have occurred
3. **Extracted water:** The difference between available and remaining

**Site positioning determines what you measure.**

**Scenario: Refugee camp extracting water from river**

The camp operates water pumps that remove 0.5 m³/s from the river to supply the population.

**If you measure upstream of the pumps:**
- You measure available water (natural flow)
- Useful for: Determining if extraction is sustainable, planning maximum safe extraction, assessing total resource

**If you measure downstream of the pumps:**
- You measure remaining water (flow after extraction)
- Useful for: Assessing impact on downstream communities, ensuring minimum flows for ecology, verifying flows leaving the area

**If you measure both upstream and downstream:**
- Difference tells you actual extraction
- Useful for: Verifying pump efficiency, detecting unauthorized extraction, balancing upstream availability with downstream impacts

**Which is needed?**

Most water resource management requires measuring available water (upstream of extraction). This tells you what the resource provides before human use, allowing sustainable management planning.

However, if there are downstream stakeholders (communities, ecosystems, international agreements), measuring downstream may also be required to demonstrate responsible use.

[VISUAL PLACEHOLDER: Diagram showing:
- River flowing left to right

- Downstream measurement site (measures remaining water)
- Arrows showing flow direction and extraction
- Labels showing "Available: 2.5 m³/s", "Extracted: 0.5 m³/s", "Remaining: 2.0 m³/s"]

### Seasonal Variability and Critical Periods

**Water resource monitoring must capture critical low-flow periods.**

Unlike flood monitoring (which focuses on high flows), water resource management depends on understanding the driest conditions.

**Strategic requirement:**

Site selection must consider:
- Dry season flows (when resources are most constrained)
- Upstream tributaries that contribute year-round vs. seasonal tributaries that dry up
- Groundwater contributions that maintain base flows

**Example scenario:**

A river reaches a refugee camp after flowing past two tributaries:
- **Tributary A:** Flows year-round, sourced from mountain springs (base flow = 0.8 m³/s even in driest season)
- **Tributary B:** Flows only during wet season, dries completely during dry season (wet season contributes 1.2 m³/s, dry season = 0 m³/s)

**Main river above both tributaries:** Dry season flow = 0.5 m³/s
**Main river at camp (below both tributaries):** Dry season flow = 0.5 + 0.8 + 0 = 1.3 m³/s

**Site options:**

**Option 1: Measure main river above Tributary A**
- Dry season measurement = 0.5 m³/s
- Does NOT represent water available to camp (underestimates by ignoring Tributary A)
- May lead to overly conservative extraction limits

**Option 2: Measure main river below both tributaries (at or just upstream of camp)**
- Dry season measurement = 1.3 m³/s
- Accurately represents water available to camp
- Allows appropriate extraction planning

**Option 3: Measure Tributary A separately**
- Captures the year-round contribution
- Useful if managing this specific tributary
- Does NOT capture main river contributions

**Correct choice:** Option 2 - measure at the location where all contributing flows have joined, just before the extraction point.

**General principle:**

For water resource monitoring, measure downstream of all tributaries that contribute during the critical (usually dry) season, but upstream of the extraction point.

[VISUAL PLACEHOLDER: Diagram showing:
- Main river and two tributaries
- Camp extraction point
- Flow values labeled for wet and dry seasons at each point
- Three potential measurement sites marked
- Annotations showing which site captures year-round contributions]

### Representative Location for Water Rights and Allocation

**Transboundary and multi-user contexts require carefully positioned sites.**

When multiple parties share water rights (upstream and downstream countries, host community and refugee camp, municipal and agricultural users), monitoring site location becomes politically and legally significant.

**Strategic criteria:**

1. **Measure at agreed reference location**
   - Often specified in water sharing agreements
   - May be "at the border crossing" or "above the diversion point"
   - Site must match legal agreement language

2. **Minimize ambiguity about what is measured**
   - Location where all parties agree the measurement represents the shared resource
   - Positioned to avoid disputes about tributary inclusions or exclusions
   - Documented geographic coordinates, not approximate descriptions

3. **Accessible to all parties**
   - Verification measurements must be possible by any stakeholder
   - Located on publicly accessible land when possible
   - Not solely controlled by one party

4. **Stable channel section**
   - Minimize need for rating curve updates that might require re-negotiation
   - Avoid locations prone to channel changes
   - Ensure long-term measurement continuity

**Real-world example concept:**

An international river crosses from Country A into Country B. An agreement states Country A must allow minimum flow of 10 m³/s to cross the border during dry season.

**Potential disputes:**
- Country A measures at point 1, just inside their border (includes one small tributary that flows 0.8 m³/s)
- Country B measures at point 2, just inside their border (excludes that tributary, 3 km upstream)
- Country A reports compliance: "12 m³/s crosses border"
- Country B reports violation: "Only 11.2 m³/s crosses border"
- Both are correct - but they are measuring different locations

**Resolution:**

Agreement must specify an exact measurement location (latitude/longitude or specific landmark), ideally:
- Immediately upstream of border (eliminates Country B's tributaries)
- Immediately downstream of Country A's last tributary (captures full contributions)
- Or at the actual border crossing if physically feasible

Site selection is not just technical - it has legal and diplomatic significance.

## Tributary Influences and Network Considerations

### When One Site Is Not Enough

Many monitoring objectives cannot be met with a single site. Understanding tributary influences helps determine if and where multiple sites are needed.

### Tributary Contributions Change System Behavior

**The basic principle:**

Each tributary that joins a river changes the flow characteristics downstream. A measurement site upstream of a major tributary tells you nothing about what happens downstream after that tributary adds its contribution.

**Example scenario:**

Main river at point A (before tributary): 8 m³/s
Tributary contributes: 4 m³/s
Main river at point B (after tributary): 12 m³/s (8 + 4)

**If you measure only at point A:**
- You know upstream conditions (8 m³/s)
- You do NOT know downstream conditions (12 m³/s)
- Cannot predict flooding at locations below the tributary junction

**If you measure only at point B:**
- You know total combined flow (12 m³/s)
- You do NOT know how much came from main river vs. tributary
- Cannot distinguish between different flood sources

**If you measure both at point A and point B:**
- You know upstream conditions, tributary contribution (by difference), and total downstream flow
- Can distinguish flood sources
- Can understand system behavior comprehensively

### When to Add Tributary Monitoring

**Criteria for considering tributary measurement sites:**

**1. Tributary contributes significantly (>20% of main river flow)**
- If tributary adds only 5% to total flow, measuring it separately may not be worth resources
- If tributary adds 30% to total flow, it significantly changes system behavior and may warrant separate monitoring

**2. Tributary has different hydrologic response than main river**
- Steep, small catchment tributary responds to rainfall in hours (flash flood risk)
- Main river has large, gentle catchment and responds in days (seasonal flood risk)
- Understanding both responses separately improves forecasting

**3. Human activities on tributary are significant**
- Water extraction from tributary
- Tributary crosses international boundary
- Separate management of tributary resource

**4. At-risk communities located on tributary**
- Villages on tributary may flood from tributary flows before main river floods occur
- Need tributary-specific warning

**Decision framework:**

Add tributary monitoring if:
- Tributary contributes >20% of flow AND
- Different hydrologic response OR significant human activities OR at-risk communities on tributary

Otherwise, measuring main river below tributary junction is usually sufficient.

[VISUAL PLACEHOLDER: Decision tree showing:
- Start: "Does tributary contribute >20% of flow?"
  - No → "Monitor main river below junction (single site sufficient)"
  - Yes → "Different response, human activities, or at-risk communities on tributary?"
    - No → "Monitor main river below junction (single site sufficient)"
    - Yes → "Add tributary monitoring site"]

### Multi-Site Network Planning

**Cascading monitoring networks provide system-wide understanding.**

In complex river systems, multiple sites arranged strategically create a comprehensive monitoring network.

**Network design principles:**

**1. Hierarchical structure**
- Main river sites capture basin-scale behavior
- Tributary sites capture sub-catchment behavior
- Arrange sites to build understanding from small to large scale

**2. Nested catchments**
- Downstream sites include all upstream contributions
- Upstream sites represent sub-catchments
- Difference between sites reveals specific sub-catchment contributions

**3. Strategic spacing**
- Sites far enough apart to show different conditions (not redundant)
- Sites close enough to relate to each other (not disconnected)
- Typical spacing: 20-100 km depending on catchment size and response time

**Example network for humanitarian flood warning:**

**Catchment description:**
Large river basin with refugee camp on main river. Two major tributaries join main river upstream of camp. Host community located between tributaries and camp.

**Monitoring network:**

**Site 1 - Upper tributary A (small catchment, steep, flash flood risk)**
- Purpose: Early warning for flash floods from this tributary
- Catchment: 120 km²
- Warning time for camp: 6-8 hours (flash floods move fast but have farther to travel)

**Site 2 - Upper tributary B (moderate catchment)**
- Purpose: Monitor second major flow source
- Catchment: 280 km²
- Warning time for camp: 5-7 hours

**Site 3 - Main river above tributaries (regional monitoring)**
- Purpose: Monitor basin-wide conditions, integrate regional rainfall
- Catchment: 890 km² (before tributaries join)
- Warning time for camp: 12-16 hours (slowest response, farthest upstream)

**Site 4 - Main river below tributary junctions, above host community (operational forecasting)**
- Purpose: Comprehensive flow monitoring including all tributaries, direct warning for host community
- Catchment: 1,290 km² (890 + 120 + 280)
- Warning time for host community: 4-6 hours
- Warning time for camp: 8-12 hours

**Network benefits:**

- Sites 1 and 2 provide early indication of tributary flood contributions
- Site 3 provides basin-wide context
- Site 4 provides definitive flow measurement for forecasting
- Combined data allows distinguishing flood sources (tributary vs. main river)
- Redundancy: If one site fails, others still provide information

**Cost-benefit consideration:**

Four sites cost significantly more than one site. Is the network justified?

**Justification criteria:**
- Large population at risk (refugee camp + host community = thousands of people)
- Complex catchment makes single-site monitoring insufficient
- Early warning improvements save lives and assets
- Long-term deployment (multi-year) spreads costs

**Alternative if resources limited:**
Start with Site 4 (most directly useful) and add Sites 1, 2, 3 progressively as resources allow.

## Multi-Site Network Coordination

### Data Integration and Operational Use

**Multiple sites are only valuable if data is integrated effectively.**

### Real-Time Data Sharing

**For networks to function, all sites must communicate.**

**Technical requirements:**
- Data from all sites transmitted to central location (cloud server, national data center, humanitarian coordination center)
- Near-real-time transmission (hourly or more frequent during events)
- Reliable data format standardization (all sites report using same units, time stamps, formats)

**OpenRiverCam advantage:**
Cloud-based data systems make multi-site integration relatively straightforward. Each site uploads data to the same central repository, accessible via web interface.

**Coordination needs:**
- One organization or coordination body manages data access and sharing
- All participating organizations have access to all network data (avoid data silos)
- Clear protocols for data use and decision-making

### Forecasting and Interpretation

**Multi-site networks enable more sophisticated forecasting.**

**Example - Cascading flood wave:**

Site 1 (far upstream) shows rapid rise: Water level increases from 1.2m to 2.8m in 6 hours, then begins falling.

Forecast for downstream:
- Site 4 (100 km downstream) will see peak flood approximately 18-24 hours after Site 1 peak
- Peak height at Site 4 depends on:
  - Magnitude at Site 1 (observed)
  - Contributions from Sites 2 and 3 (observed)
  - Channel characteristics and tributary additions between sites (modeled or historically understood)

**With network data:**
Forecasters can say: "Site 1 peaked at 2.8m 8 hours ago. Sites 2 and 3 are currently rising and will contribute additional flow. We expect Site 4 to peak at 3.5-4.0m in 10-16 hours."

**Without network data (only Site 4):**
Forecasters must rely on rainfall forecasts and historical relationships, with higher uncertainty: "Rainfall has been heavy upstream. Site 4 may reach 3.0-5.0m sometime in the next 24 hours."

Network data improves forecast precision and confidence.

### Institutional Coordination

**Multi-site networks often involve multiple organizations.**

**Common scenarios:**
- National meteorological service operates main river sites
- Humanitarian organization operates tributary site near camp
- Local government operates site near host community

**Coordination requirements:**

**1. Data sharing agreements**
- All parties agree to share data openly (or define access rules)
- Specify data ownership and use rights
- Address privacy and security concerns if any

**2. Technical standardization**
- Use compatible equipment and methods where possible
- Adopt common data formats and transmission protocols
- Coordinate survey procedures (coordinate systems, datum, units)

**3. Quality assurance**
- Agree on verification and calibration standards
- Cross-check sites against each other
- Coordinate field verification campaigns

**4. Maintenance planning**
- Share resources for surveys when feasible
- Coordinate equipment procurement
- Train staff across organizations for backup capacity

**Practical advice for humanitarian organizations:**

When planning multi-site networks involving multiple actors:
1. Start with informal collaboration (share data even without formal agreement)
2. Demonstrate value of integrated data
3. Formalize agreements once benefits are clear
4. Use regional coordination platforms (e.g., national hydrological services, river basin organizations) to facilitate collaboration

## Real-World Application Example

### Strategic Site Selection for Flood Early Warning

**Context:**
Humanitarian organization operating refugee camp in tropical country. Camp located on banks of moderate-sized river (typical flow 15-30 m³/s). Seasonal flooding threatens camp during wet season. Objective: Deploy OpenRiverCam-based early warning system to provide 3-6 hours advance warning.

**Step 1: Define protection area and warning requirements**
- At-risk population: 8,000 refugees in camp
- Required actions: Evacuation to higher ground (1.5 km from camp), securing assets
- Time needed: Minimum 3 hours for organized evacuation
- Desired warning: 4-6 hours to allow preparation

**Step 2: Map catchment and potential sites**

Site investigation team uses topographic maps and local knowledge to identify:

**Site A - Tributary 18 km upstream**
- Small catchment (145 km²)
- Steep terrain, flash flood potential
- Travel time to camp: 3-4 hours (fast flow in steep channel)
- Warning time: 3-4 hours

**Site B - Main river 35 km upstream**
- Moderate catchment (680 km²)
- Includes tributary that joins 8 km below this site
- Travel time to camp: 7-9 hours (moderate flow, gentle gradient)
- Warning time: 7-9 hours

**Site C - Main river 12 km upstream**
- Large catchment (950 km²) - includes all major tributaries before camp
- Gentle gradient
- Travel time to camp: 3-4 hours (slow flow in large river)
- Warning time: 3-4 hours

**Step 3: Assess hydrologic representativeness**

**Site A analysis:**
- Represents tributary only, not main river
- Tributary contributes ~25% of flood flows
- Flash floods from tributary can cause localized flooding, but not main camp floods
- Does NOT represent main river flooding (camp's primary risk)
- **Conclusion:** Insufficient representativeness - monitors wrong flood source

**Site B analysis:**
- Represents main river and large catchment
- BUT excludes tributary that contributes 25% of flow (joins downstream of this site)
- Measurements will underestimate flood magnitude at camp
- Provides excellent warning time (7-9 hours) but questionable accuracy
- **Conclusion:** Marginal - good warning time but incomplete representation

**Site C analysis:**
- Includes all major tributaries (represents 95% of catchment affecting camp)
- Strong hydrologic connection to camp (same river reach)
- Provides adequate warning time (3-4 hours, meets minimum requirement)
- **Conclusion:** Best representativeness for camp flood risk

**Step 4: Apply technical criteria (Sections 6.1-6.4)**

Field assessment at Site C:
- Tracers: Good (bridge piers generate foam, urban debris present) - Score 7/9
- Lighting: Moderate (bridge provides some shadow during midday) - Score 6/9
- Flow uniformity: Good (section 40m downstream of bridge is relatively uniform) - Score 7/9
- Accessibility: Excellent (paved road, bridge platform, year-round access) - Score 9/9

Field assessment at Site B:
- Tracers: Excellent (natural rapids create abundant foam) - Score 9/9
- Lighting: Excellent (open area, good sun angles) - Score 9/9
- Flow uniformity: Excellent (natural riffle with uniform flow) - Score 8/9
- Accessibility: Marginal (unpaved track, wet season access uncertain) - Score 4/9

**Step 5: Balance representativeness, warning time, and technical feasibility**

**Comparison:**

| Criterion | Site B (35 km upstream) | Site C (12 km upstream) |
|-----------|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| Warning time | Excellent (7-9 hours) | Adequate (3-4 hours) |
| Representativeness | Marginal (misses 25% of catchment) | Excellent (95% of catchment) |
| Technical criteria | Excellent for tracers/lighting/flow, Poor accessibility | Good overall, Excellent accessibility |
| Operational feasibility | Difficult wet season maintenance | Reliable year-round operation |

**Decision:**

**Select Site C** - Main river 12 km upstream, despite shorter warning time

**Rationale:**
1. Warning time (3-4 hours) meets minimum requirement for evacuation
2. Hydrologic representativeness is critical - must measure actual flood risk to camp
3. Site B's excellent warning time does not compensate for missing 25% of flood flows and accessibility challenges
4. Operational reliability (accessibility, year-round maintenance) ensures system continues functioning during critical wet season

**Outcome:**
Site C deployed with supplementary rain gauge network in upstream catchment to provide additional early indication. Combined rainfall data + river monitoring provides effective early warning within operational constraints.

**Lessons:**

- Longest warning time is not always best - representativeness matters more
- Accessibility and operational reliability outweigh technically superior but impractical sites
- Multi-parameter monitoring (rainfall + river flow) can compensate for shorter warning times
- Strategic siting is about balancing competing factors, not maximizing one criterion

## Summary: Key Concepts for Strategic Site Selection

**Fundamental principle:**
Site selection must align with monitoring objectives. There is no universally "best" site - only sites that provide the right information for specific decisions.

**Catchment representation:**
Every site represents its upstream catchment. Sites measure what drains to that point. Understanding catchments is essential for interpreting what measurements mean.

**Flood warning criteria:**
- Balance warning time (far enough upstream) with representativeness (hydrologically connected)
- Flash floods require local sites (small catchments, short warning times acceptable)
- Seasonal floods allow distant sites (large catchments, longer warning times)
- Include major tributaries or measure them separately

**Water resource monitoring criteria:**
- Measure upstream of extraction points (available water)
- Include all dry-season contributing tributaries
- Focus on low-flow conditions (critical for resource management)
- For transboundary contexts, position sites to minimize ambiguity

**Tributary influences:**
- Major tributaries (>20% contribution) change system behavior
- Measure below tributary junctions to capture combined flows
- Consider separate tributary monitoring if different response, significant activities, or at-risk communities

**Multi-site networks:**
- Provide system-wide understanding
- Enable source identification and improved forecasting
- Require data sharing, coordination, standardization
- Justify costs with large populations at risk or complex catchments
- Start with highest-priority site, expand progressively

**Representative location checklist:**
- Does this site measure what I need to know?
- Does it represent the catchment/area I care about?
- Does it provide adequate warning time (if flood monitoring)?
- Does it capture critical low flows (if water resource monitoring)?
- Is it acceptable to all stakeholders (if transboundary)?

**Integration with technical criteria:**
Strategic placement determines where you want to measure. Technical criteria (Sections 6.1-6.4) determine if measurement is feasible at that location. Both must be satisfied.

**Practical priority:**
For humanitarian applications with limited resources, prioritize:
1. Hydrologic representativeness (measures the right thing)
2. Adequate warning time (sufficient for protective action)
3. Operational reliability (accessible, maintainable)
4. Technical feasibility (tracers, lighting, flow, accessibility)

Perfect sites rarely exist. Select sites that best balance competing factors to meet operational needs.
