# 8.1 Power Equipment Installation - Solar

## Overview

Solar power systems provide reliable, independent power for OpenRiverCam installations in locations without grid access or where grid power is unreliable. This section provides step-by-step procedures for installing solar panels, batteries, charge controllers, and associated components. Proper installation ensures system reliability, longevity, and safety.

**Time Required:** 4-6 hours for complete installation

**Prerequisites:**
- Site survey and power calculations completed (Chapter 7)
- All equipment delivered and inspected
- Mounting structures installed or prepared

## Safety Considerations

**CRITICAL SAFETY WARNINGS:**

- **Electrical Hazards:** Solar panels generate electricity whenever exposed to light. Cover panels completely during installation or work during low-light conditions.
- **Fall Protection:** Use appropriate fall protection when working at height. Never work alone on elevated installations.
- **Battery Safety:** Lead-acid batteries contain sulfuric acid and generate explosive hydrogen gas during charging. Wear eye protection and ensure adequate ventilation.
- **Lightning Protection:** Proper grounding is essential. Improper installation increases lightning strike risk.
- **Tool Safety:** Use insulated tools rated for electrical work. Verify tools are in good condition.

**Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) Required:**

## Step 1: Solar Panel Mounting

### 1.1 Verify Mounting Structure

**Procedure:**
1. Inspect the mounting structure installed during site preparation
2. Verify all bolts are tight and structure is level
3. Check that structure orientation matches site survey specifications
4. Confirm clearance for panel tilt adjustment (if applicable)
5. Verify structure can support panel weight plus wind loading

**Quality Check:**
- Structure does not move when moderate force applied
- All connection points are secure
- Surface is level within 2 degrees
- No rust or corrosion on mounting hardware

### 1.2 Determine Optimal Panel Orientation

**Azimuth (Compass Direction):**
- **Northern Hemisphere:** Face panels toward true south
- **Southern Hemisphere:** Face panels toward true north
- **Equatorial Regions:** Face panels toward equator
- **Correction:** Adjust for magnetic declination in your location

**Example:** If site is in Indonesia (magnetic declination approximately 0-2 degrees east), face panels 178-180 degrees on compass for true south.

**Tilt Angle (Elevation):**
- **General Rule:** Set tilt angle equal to site latitude
- **Year-Round Optimization:** Latitude angle provides best annual average
- **Seasonal Adjustment:** Latitude + 15° for winter; Latitude - 15° for summer
- **Fixed Installation:** Use latitude angle unless specific seasonal needs exist

**Example Calculation for Sukabumi, Indonesia (Latitude 6.9°S):**
- Optimal tilt: 7 degrees from horizontal
- Face: North (toward equator)
- Acceptable range: 5-10 degrees

**Practical Considerations:**
- **Minimum Tilt:** Never less than 5 degrees (allows rain to clean panels)
- **Dust and Debris:** Increase tilt 5-10 degrees in dusty environments
- **Horizon Obstructions:** Ensure no shading from trees, buildings, or terrain
- **Wind Exposure:** Lower tilt reduces wind loading in exposed locations

### 1.3 Mount Solar Panel Brackets
