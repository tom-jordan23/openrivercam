## Risk Management

### Identified Risks and Mitigation Strategies

**Risk 1: Scope Creep**
- **Mitigation:** Strict adherence to OUTLINE.md scope; any additions go to v1.1 backlog

**Risk 2: Visual Asset Delays**
- **Mitigation:** Parallel visual development; start early; use placeholders if needed

**Risk 3: Technical Complexity Underestimated**
- **Mitigation:** Early non-technical review; iterate explanations; add more visuals

**Risk 4: Field Photo Availability**
- **Mitigation:** Use photos from Indonesia deployment; supplement with diagrams; take additional photos if needed

**Risk 5: Software Access for Screenshots**
- **Mitigation:** Coordinate access early; use test installations; document access requirements

**Risk 6: Review Bandwidth**
- **Mitigation:** Schedule reviews in advance; provide clear review criteria; limit review scope per milestone

**Risk 7: Timeline Optimism**
- **Mitigation:** Build in buffer time; prioritize critical path items; be ready to defer nice-to-haves to v1.1

**Risk 8: Lack of Field Testing Opportunity**
- **Mitigation:** Desk-based review with field-experienced staff; remote review with field teams; post-release validation
